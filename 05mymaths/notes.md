### random number

rand.Seed() is used to initialize the random number generator with a seed value. 

## Purpose of rand.Seed()

The math/rand package in Go generates pseudo-random numbers.
These numbers are not truly random; they are determined by an initial value called the seed. 
Without setting a unique seed, the random number generator produces the same sequence of numbers on each run of the program.
